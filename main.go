// WSI short for Wolf Software Installer
// This projects idea is to create a simple CLI tool for making a installer for a binary program.
// The first couple features to be implemented are:
// 1. Allow for the installer to add path's to the PATH environment variable.
// 2. Allow for the installer to hold static binary files that get copied to a specified location.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Welcome to WSI")
}
